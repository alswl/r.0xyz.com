Redirect https://r.0xyz.com/?to=$url to $url.

If I want open `obsidian://open?vault=my-logs&file=journals%2F2023%2F2023-06%2F2023-06-02` in some web editor that did not support Obsidian schema.

How to use:

```
# https://example.com
https://r.0xyz.com/?to=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com

# obsidian://open?vault=yours&file=yours
https://r.0xyz.com/?to=obsidian%3A%2F%2Fopen%3Fvault%3Dyours%26file%3Dyours

# slack://yours
https://r.0xyz.com/?to=slack%3A%2F%2Fyours
```
